AngularJS Exam
==============

This is a simple application that get informations about Edools in github and show it in a list.

The informations that this app can get are:

- Avatar from Edools
- The created account date from Edools
- Repositories names and links from Edools
- Members (names, avatars and links)

A CSS pre-processor used for this project is LESS because is more simple (like this project :) ).

Considerations:

My real challenge in this task is learn (and write code) Angular.JS and finally start to use github. And all this in just 3 days! If I don't get the job, at least i learn something new!

Thank you for the opportunity!
