AngularJS Exam
==============

Features I implemented:

- List repositories
- Filter repositories
- Show repository README in details

I tried to implement authentication but it could be done on the browser. The exactly same request (to get the oauth) that succeded with `curl`, failed on the browser.

Running:

- Clone the repo
- `npm install`
- `npm install -g bower grunt-cli`
- `bower install`
- `grunt serve`

Running the tests:

`grunt test`

Building:

`grunt build`
