AngularJS Exam - Hugo Dutra
============================

Hi, guys!
This is my answer to the exam. 

You will be able to choose between four organizations to list their repositories. Inside each repository you can list their issues, if it has any, see some issues informations and open the issue on github.

To complete the exam I used Grunt, Less, Karma and Bower.

To run the app after cloning the repository you need to:

1 - Install Npm dependecies using npm install (maybe you have to use 'sudo' here)
2 - Install bower dependencies using bower install
3 - Run 'grunt serve' and the app will open on your browser
4 - To run the tests you can run 'grunt test' or 'karma start karma.conf.js'

I REALLY hope you all like it!

Thanks!
