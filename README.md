AngularJS Exam
==============

Dear developer, the goal of this exam is know a little more about your programming skills. Here at Edools we value too much excellence, a code with good quality makes us work better and happier :), and increase our ability to deliver customer value with speed and consistency. With this in mind, we want to know how you think the code, and how is your relationship with him.

The task is simple: play with the Github API. You will have to develop an application using AngularJS that will consume some public resources from Github through its API ( https://developer.github.com/ ), and present in a simple way but well-structured. Here are some suggestions of what you can do:

- List repositories
- Filter repositories
- List the issues inside repository visualization
- Create a comment when viewing a issue
- ...

To get started, just do the fork of this repository, implement and then make a pull request, listing the features in the README that you have developed and how to run it.

It is very important that you show us your knowledge regarding good programming practices, testing, patterns and even the bad practices. Therefore, take these points into consideration when choosing and implementing your features.

Besides coding skills, there are two things that aren't strictly required but would be nice to see you using:

- a CSS pre-processor of your choice
- a build system like Grunt, Gulp or even Broccoli, we like to experiment with different things here at Edools :)

And if you feel really inspired, tell us how did you make your decisions regarding tools choosing.

We wish you good luck, and may the Quality be with you!
